This script will perform a seamless removal of all Cherry VM Manager stack components.
If any of the CVMM stack components were modified or deleted prior to the execution of this script
it may not delete them succesfully, however unlike the cherry-install.sh script,
it will not stop, but continue to delete other components.

It is not recommended to run the removal without reading the documentation first!
